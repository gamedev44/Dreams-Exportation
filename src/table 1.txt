**Additional Information**

* **Slice information:** Dreams audio is made up of slices, which are small chunks of audio data. The number of slices in a sound determines its audio cost.
* **Sample information:** Dreams audio samples are the original audio files that are used to create slices. The quality of the sample will affect the sound quality of the slice.
* **Timeline information:** The timeline is a graph that shows the timing of all of the sounds in your creation. If sounds are overlapping on the timeline, this can cause them to play with a delay.
* **Dreams audio file format:** Dreams audio files are in the .dat9 format. This format is optimized for use with Dreams and allows for high-quality audio playback.
* **Importing audio from other formats:** Dreams can import audio from a variety of formats, including MP3, WMV, and WAV. When you import audio from another format, it is converted into the .dat9 format.
* **Exporting audio:** Dreams can export audio in a variety of formats, including MP3, WMV, and WAV. When you export audio, it is converted from the .dat9 format to the selected format.
